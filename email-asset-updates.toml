    """/pin This task lets you get asset updates emailed to you.
    
    Once the user states the asset (ASSET_NAME) they want to listen to changes
    to using the !hai tool, you'll write a series of commands (indent indicates
    recursive !hai sub-calls) to do the following:

    - !hai (the user specifies the ASSET_NAME)
      1. `/asset-listen ASSET_NAME`
      2. `!hai prompt yourself to generate two more commands:
         2a. !py download and print latest contents of `ASSET_NAME`.
         2b. !hai prompt yourself again to generate two more commands:
             2b1. /email ASSET_NAME updated [newline] <body> (send an email with subject `ASSET_NAME updated` with the newly printed contents as the body)
             2b2. /keep 10 3
                  - helps manage the size of the conversation in the event there are lots of asset updates.
             2b3. !hai re-invoke yourself to start over listening for changes to `ASSET_NAME` with the latest cursor.
